# new-ip-ssh-finder
A useful tool for detecting a new ip address when plugging a new device in to a network.

# Dependencies
Requires that you have python-nmap or python3-nmap installed depending upon which version of python you are using

# Todo
Need to make it dynamic so that it can scan IP addresses other than ones in the 192.168.1.1-255 range
